= What I need to do =
    1. [X] Front-end build it so grid and chat are next to each other
    2. [X] Make the chat functional
    3. [X] Move all grid init logic to the back-end server
        1. [X] Partly done
        2. [X] 100%done
    4. [X] Make it so that games are initialized by creating a room
    5. [X] Make it so that joining a room joins the game
        1. [X] Player can join the game
        2. [X] Player's control different units
        3. [X] After x people, people that join are observers only
    6. [X] Make players color coded
    7. [X] One player in a room should(options):
        1. [X] Have a waiting lobby type thing, a pregame practice mode
        2. [X] Do nothing that can affect chances of winning the game
    8. [ ] There needs to be a smooth separation of player control
        1. [ ] Right now if you create a game and join a game two events get
               sent
        2. [ ] This double's actions and creates unnecessary computation
        3. [ ] But it should be done in a way that allows reconnection
    9. [X] Leaving a game needs handling
        1. [X] Should allow reconnect if no other games are joined
        2. [X] Should forfeit if another game joined
    10. [O] I want everything to be responsive and usable on mobile devices
        1. [X] On desktop resolutions 
            1. [X] The squares should be a pleasant enough
                   size so that everything is visible and proportionate 
        2. [o] On mobile resolutions
            1. [o] Everything should still be present and usable
                1. [X] But displaying the grid/chat should be toggled
                2. [ ] Buttons need work
    11. [X] Establish Win and Lose Conditions
    12. [X] Make a game history page
    13. [ ] Make a tutorial
    14. [ ] A production version

= What I was doing last =

** Started a major refactor, might need some more planning. 

I want a tutorial feature
On logging in, you get a message informing you that typing /tutorial starts it
Tutorial will display the keys you press and go over the rules. 


It looks like there are problems so far: 
I don't think interaction is cut off with previous room

Typing /tutorial 
    * [X] should remove you from current game
    * [X] should place you in a private instance that can't be joined
        * [X] It should isolate you from seeing what's going on outside the
    * [X] A few messages should be sent
    * [X] Create a function that sends messages in a timed manner
        * [X] Something informing you of the keys
        * [X] Something that informs you the rules of the game
    * [ ] In the private instance, you should be able to move around and interact
    * [ ] Maybe have a reset button if user triggers a loss condition
    * [ ] Nothing in the tutorial should affect game history
