= What I need to do =
    1. [X] Front-end build it so grid and chat are next to each other
    2. [X] Make the chat functional
    3. [X] Move all grid init logic to the back-end server
        1. [X] Partly done
        2. [X] 100%done
    4. [X] Make it so that games are initialized by creating a room
    5. [X] Make it so that joining a room joins the game
        1. [X] Player can join the game
        2. [X] Player's control different units
        3. [X] After x people, people that join are observers only
    6. [X] Make players color coded
    7. [ ] One player in a room should(options):
        1. [ ] Have a waiting lobby type thing, a pregame practice mode
        2. [ ] Do nothing that can affect chances of winning the game
        3. [ ] 
    8. [ ] There needs to be a smooth separation of player control
        1. [ ] Right now if you create a game and join a game two events get
               sent
        2. [ ] This double's actions and creates unnecessary computation
        3. [ ] But it should be done in a way that allows reconnection
    9. [o] Leaving a game needs handling
        1. [X] Should allow reconnect if no other games are joined
        2. [ ] Should forfeit if another game joined
    10. [ ] I want everything to be responsive and usable on mobile devices
        1. [ ] On desktop resolutions 
            1. [ ] The squares should be a pleasant enough
                   size so that everything is visible and proportionate 
        2. [ ] On mobile resolutions
            1. [ ] Everything should still be present and usable
                1. [ ] But displaying the grid/chat should be toggled
    11. [ ] Establish Win and Lose Conditions
    12. [ ] Make a tutorial

= What I was doing last =
    * Establish win/lose conditions
        * Game state will have a record of score and final result
        * Api will send a message saying "you won/lost"
            * [.] Collision detection will be the initial win/loss state
                * [ ] If a player collides with themself, loss
                * [.] If a player collides with an enemy, loss
                    * [X] I think this will be easier. If moving coord exists 
                          within enemy's body, collision detected
                    * [ ] Attach a win/loss condition
        * Front-end will act appropriately
            * [X] Text Overlay saying if you won/loss
            * [ ] Scoreboard displaying score
            * [ ] Losing player can't move
            * [ ] Winning player maybe can move? 
            * [ ] Chat continues to work
            * [ ] When everyone leaves the room, game closes out
                * [ ] No longer accessible
                    * [ ] Join Button not present
                * [ ] But the record is kept somewhere
